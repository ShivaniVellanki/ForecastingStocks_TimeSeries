# ForecastingStocks_TimeSeries
The project forecasts Apple Inc and Honeywell Inc stock prices using time series analysis and regression. It evaluates trends, applies smoothing methods for short-term forecasts, and uses WMA for long-term predictions. The study concludes with investment advice based on forecast accuracy.

The project involves forecasting stock prices for Apple Inc and Honeywell Inc over 252 days using time series analysis and regression. It compares trends and volumes, applying exponential smoothing and adjusted exponential smoothing to predict short-term stock movements. The analysis includes calculating benefit-cost ratios and generating frequency distributions for both companies. Despite variations in prediction accuracy, the project seeks to forecast future stock prices based on past data.

Long-term forecasting uses the Weighted Moving Average (WMA) and regression analysis to predict stock prices. The analysis reveals Apple Inc's forecasts align closely with actual values, whereas Honeywell's forecasts show significant deviation. Residual analysis indicates homoscedasticity and normal distribution of residuals, suggesting the validity of the forecasting models. The project concludes with investment recommendations based on the comparative analysis of stock performance and forecasting accuracy for both companies.
